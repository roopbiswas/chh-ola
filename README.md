In the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, Chh-OLA, the taxi-hailing startup led by Khanchandani, Harsh and Dwivedi garnered a lot of interest and funding from the investors. Five years later, Chh-OLA is successfully running a number of taxis on the streets of New Delhi and garnering significant profit.  Now, Chh-OLA has opened a Data Science division recently and you have been recruited into the division. As part of your training, Shruti, the head of the Data Science division, has given you a task of estimating total fare amount of trips using various trip parameters such as distance, passenger count etc.  Can you fulfil this task given by your head?
